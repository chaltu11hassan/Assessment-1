    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and 
    set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
let planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
let analysisOfRequirements = " This is the second step where we determine what the application is supposed to do and its requirements."
let Design = "This is the third step where we model the way a software application will work, including the architecture, user interface, programming, and security."
let Implementation = "This is the fourth step where we configuring the software for certain conditions of use, as well as training customers to work with the product."
let TestingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, where a type of software testing in which the different units, modules or components of a software application are tested as a combined entity."
let Maintain = "This is the sixth step, after the product is in full operation; where maintenance of software can include software upgrades, repairs, and fixes of the software if it breaks."
